It has been edited (October, 2019) in order to update my service in ministry since that time during the 90s.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMy father's family was religious (Southern Baptist), but neither my mother nor my father went to church. (Toward the end of his life, my father found the Lord.) \r\n</p><p>\r\nOn my mom's side, we were given a box of her treasures. Inside the box, there was a Swedish Bible from her dad that was passed down to me, as well as her christening dress. \r\n</p><p>\r\nExcept for a short period of time when I was around five, my life was basically irreligious. I did ride a bus to Sunday School on the base where we lived. When I was about five, I was given a Bible for S/S attendance that I kept until I was almost an adult. I would occasionally read the scripture.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne summer I when I was a young teen, I went to visit my father at his home in Arkansas in the country. Many of my father's neighbors were poor, but very religious people. Across the dirt road from my father's house was a family who had a church in their home. They met on the Sabbath. They were Seventh-day Adventist. My dad allowed me to go over there on Saturday and worship with them.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSeveral summers later, I went to the Baptist summer camp held at a cousin's church. At that camp, I went forward during one of the meetings because I realized my need for a savior. During camp, I also met a Southern Baptist missionary. I was impressed by his sermon.  After it was over,  I went up to him and asked: \"Why do we go to church on Sunday. but other people and the Jews go to church on Saturday?\" He told me not to worry about it, but I did anyway.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI went home from that summer camp and joined the Pecan Springs Baptist Church in Austin, TX which I attended for a period of time. I was baptized by immersion in this church. After a while, I drifted away and started living in ways that were not Christian.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt was not until I was in Technical School in the early 70's that I was to come back to God. It was one night during an Amateur Radio Club meeting at my school. That club meeting turned into a Bible study. By this time in my life, I had lapsed into the error of Theistic Evolution. One of the men there named Bill Priester told me that evolution could be completely disproved. I was skeptical until I came to find out that he was right.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter some time, I moved to Southern California and married.  I was asked me to preach while we lived in the Pasadena area at a nearby church in Arcadia.          It was here that I came in contact with the Seventh-Day Baptist people. I used to pass a Seventh-Day Baptist Church that was in Los Angeles on Figueroa Street. My wife, Cindy, and I decided to try going there. Chuck Graffius was the pastor there. While there, we met John and Ruth Piel. We continued to go there until we moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, in late 1979.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile in Salt Lake, Cindy and I found it difficult to find a church in that city we could attend. I contacted the Church of God, 7th Day in Denver, Colorado. Cindy and I joined that church and were asked by their Western District coordinator to try to start a church in Salt Lake City. We started a fellowship while living there. I also had a radio ministry on Sundays called The Words of Life.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nI did not discover that many of the ministers in the Church of God 7th day believed that Christ was created until we moved to Fresno, CA. I was assured by some of my friends who were leading ministers in that church that the doctrine was being reviewed. \r\n</p><p>\r\nI then moved to Little Rock, Arkansas in 1985 and started to attend the Little Rock Seventh-day Baptist Church. We joined the church, but retained membership in the Church of God 7th Day until 1993 when I was made an Asst. Pastor in the Little Rock Seventh-day Baptist Church. At this time, I began a ministerial training program called TIME (training in ministry by extension). \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile living in Little Rock, Arkansas as a member of the Little Rock Seventh Day Baptist Church and working for Motorola, I found a Missionary Baptist Seminary. There it was possible for me to go to school at night where I eventually attained an AA degree in Bible, and then a bachelor's degree in Bible. I went on to a Master's Degree in Theology. Finally, I gained my doctorate in Biblical Languages in 2002. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFrom 1985 to the year 2000,  I preached at the Seventh-Day Baptist church in Little Rock Arkansas. During that time, I shared the pulpit at the Little Rock SDB Church. In 2000, I moved my membership to Faith Seventh-Day Baptist church where I was a faithful member of the Doniphan, MO church for several years. (Since then, I was asked to preach in view of a call in Ft. Worth and Ashaway, RI. I accepted the call to Remembrance Seventh Day Baptist Church where we became members and have been since 2006. During my time in Ft. Worth, I have been accredited by the denomination as a pastor. This has been recently renewed. I pastored there for 14 years, having recently retired in Aug. 2019. In 2005, I traveled there twice monthly to preach.) I am a Seventh Day Baptist, a Sabbatarian, and a Baptist, but most of all I am a follower of Jesus. I know that God has given me gifts and talents. I believe he has called me to the ministry.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt present, I am filling the pulpit at Remembrance SDB in Fort Worth when capable until such time as they find a pastor.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI love the Seventh Day Baptists that I have met, from all around the United States. I have attended the South West Association and the Conference for several years representing the Little Rock Seventh Day Baptist Church, as well as the Fort Worth REMEMBRANCE Seventh Day Baptist Church in later years.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Call to the Ministry:\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe 1926 Church Manual gives Seven different ways to recognize the call of the Lord. These are: 1) Advice of friends; 2) Voice of the Church; 3) Personal fitness; 4) Personal inclination; 5) Need for workers; 6) Voice of the Holy Spirit; 7) Doors closed. (pp. 81-88)\r\n</p><p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Advice of friends: Over the past few years I have gotten to know several Seventh Day Baptist pastors. I have become friends with them. Several of them have asked me when I was going to pursue the ministry. One of these was my friend Dale Smalley in Wisconsin. After meeting me and talking with me a few hours, during which time I don't believe the term ministry had come up, Dale asked me when I was going to go into the ministry.\r\n    </li><li>\r\n    Voice of the Church: The Little Rock Church licensed me to the ministry several years ago. This was a recognition of the call by my local church. The church confirmed that \"Voice of the Church\" recognition when they voted recently to have me ordained. The first recognition of the call came when I was asked to preach in Arcadia, California The first church recognition of the call took place when Ken Lawson, the Western District Overseer for the Church of God, Seventh Day met with me and asked me to start a congregation in Salt Lake City, Utah. Another church recognition of the call came again when I was asked by the Church of God Seventh Day in Jonesboro to become their preacher.\r\n    </li><li>\r\n    Personal fitness: The ability to do work beyond my current education is important. In the 90s, Rod Henry sent a letter to me acknowledging that a paper I had written for Summer Institute was written at a graduate level. That was beyond my current level of education at that time. I also would note that many have commented over the years on my ability to preach and to teach. \r\n    </li><li>\r\n    Personal inclination: The scripture says that if a man desire the office of a bishop he desires a good work. (I Timothy 3:1). This is the scripture that is the basis of my call to the ministry. I started to feel the call to the ministry in California when I started a newsletter. I began the work to help others who were hurting from their experience in a cult. God has blessed me with certain talents. These are not of my own, He has given them to me. I, with Paul, must say \"Woe unto me, if I preach not the gospel.\" It is my duty. It is my desire. It is what I believe God has put me here to do.\r\n    </li><li>\r\n    The need for workers: When I first moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, the pulpit was being filled with Sunday ministers. The Little Rock Church needed Seventh Day Baptists in the pulpit. I believe that God has met that need through the preaching of Ken Van Horn and myself and those who followed us.\r\n    </li><li>\r\n    Voice of the Holy Spirit: I recently took a Spiritual Gifts test. It showed that I was gifted in the area of preaching and teaching. I feel a need to preach. \r\n    </li><li>\r\n    Doors closed: The doors to ordination were closed when I was in the Church of God, Seventh Day (COG7D). Even though the church recognized my gifts, and I was asked to fill the roles of a pastor in Salt Lake City, Utah and in Jonesboro, AR the church did not ordain me. While researching the issue of the Trinity, I read the C.S. Lewis book, Mere Christianity.  There I found a reasonable explanation of the Trinity doctrine which helped me move away from the COG7D.  I believe that God called me to be a minister, but has waited till I was ready and in the right place.\r\n    </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</p><p>\r\nI believe that in each of the seven areas mentioned God has confirmed my call to the ministry.\r\n</p>\r\n<FlavorText book=\"Psalm\" chapter=\"46\" verse=\"1\" text=\"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.\"/>\r\n</section>\r\n</>\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default Testimony;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport LogoHeader from './logo-header';\r\nimport Navigation from './navigation';\r\nimport Home from './home';\r\nimport Papers from './papers';\r\nimport Podcast from './podcast';\r\nimport Testimony from './testimony';\r\n\r\nconst App=()=> {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <LogoHeader/>\r\n      <Navigation />\r\n      <Home />\r\n      <Papers />\r\n      <Podcast />\r\n      <Testimony />\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\r\n// register() is not called by default.\r\n\r\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\r\n// it offline capabilities.
